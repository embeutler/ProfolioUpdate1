                <h3> My Tech Story...</h3>
            </p>

            <p> It all started Christmas Morning 1989 me and my little brother would wake up to a life changing gift
                eventhough we wouldn't know it at the time. Santa Clause had given us Prodigy it was a disk that would
                allow us to connect to people all over
                the world. At the time I had no clue just what the web would bring and the amount of time I would spend
                on "bulletin boards". Fastforward a few years to senior year of highschool (1998) I began to learn HTMLl
                and build my 1st website.

                <p> After returning from a study abroad progam in Italy (art history) I had the urge to start building
                    again, so I decided to signed up for a web design class at the local JC. From there I would build a
                    few more sites for friends and then
                    move into a new job of helping create an online reference database for a sound distrubuter. After
                    that project ended in the early 2000's I would move on to the telecom industry.</p>            <p>Shortly after starting my career in the telecom industry as a phone rep, I was hired to work within
                    the finance department on a prohject for automating internal processes and document retention. From
                    there I would assist creating a database
                    that would allow for offline reps to track work then intergrate it into the company wide billing
                    systems.
           <p> When those projects ended I moved on to work on a reference content project that would take all
                        the company policies and procedures throuh a complete overhaul and began creating smart tools
                        that would integrate company polices amd
                        procedure within company specific systems used by reps through out the company. In this project
                        I server as one of the main project managers for all rewrites of policies and procedures working
                        with various teams throught out the
                        company.
                    </p>
                    <p> This project lead into the creation of smart guides that utilize iLog (busiess rule engine) and
                        allowed for proceses to become automated for customers. The project resulted in reducing company
                        overhead by $25 million a year with in
                        customer contacts centers. </p>
